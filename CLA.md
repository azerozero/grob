# Contributor License Agreement

Version 1.0 -- 2026-02-24

## Parties

**"You"** means the individual or legal entity submitting a Contribution.
If You are making a Contribution on behalf of your employer or another
entity, You represent that You have the authority to bind that entity to
this Agreement.

**"A00 SASU"** ("We", "Us") is a French simplified joint-stock company
(SASU), the maintainer of the Grob project.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any
modification or addition to existing work, that You submit to Us for
inclusion in the Grob project. "Submit" means any form of electronic
or written communication sent to Us (e.g., pull requests, patches,
issues), excluding communications conspicuously marked
"Not a Contribution."

**"Material"** means the Grob software and associated documentation
made available by Us to third parties.

## 1. Grant of Copyright License

You grant to A00 SASU a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce,
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and any derivative works
thereof.

## 2. Grant of Patent License

You grant to A00 SASU a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your
Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution
alone or by combination of Your Contribution with the Material to which
it was submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that Your Contribution constitutes patent infringement, then any patent
licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that
Contribution shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 3. Outbound License

As a condition on the exercise of the rights granted in Sections 1
and 2, We agree to license Your Contribution:

(a) under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License
    version 3.0 (AGPL-3.0) as currently used for the Material; and

(b) under any other license, including commercial and proprietary
    licenses, that We may use to distribute the Material.

This means We may distribute Your Contribution under the AGPL-3.0,
under a commercial license, or under both simultaneously. This is the
mechanism that enables dual licensing of the Grob project.

## 4. Moral Rights

To the extent that moral rights apply to Your Contribution under
applicable law (including but not limited to French law, "droit moral"),
this Agreement does not modify or limit Your moral rights. You retain
your rights of attribution and integrity.

## 5. Ownership

You retain all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.
Except for the licenses granted herein to A00 SASU and recipients of
software distributed by A00 SASU, You reserve all rights in Your
Contributions.

## 6. Representations

You represent that:

(a) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses.

(b) Each Contribution is Your original creation or You have sufficient
    rights to submit it under the terms of this Agreement.

(c) If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that You
    create, You have received permission to make Contributions on
    behalf of that employer, or Your employer has waived such rights
    for Your Contributions.

(d) You will notify Us of any facts or circumstances of which You
    become aware that would make these representations inaccurate.

## 7. No Obligation

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except
to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support
for free, for a fee, or not at all.

## 8. Disclaimer

YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 9. Acceptance

You accept this Agreement by submitting a Contribution to the Grob
project, provided that You have indicated Your acceptance through the
CLA signing process (commenting on a pull request as instructed by
the CLA bot).
