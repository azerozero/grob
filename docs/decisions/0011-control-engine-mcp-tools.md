# ADR-0011: ControlEngine Generic + MCP-Tools-First Configuration Surface

## Context and Problem Statement

Grob exposes configuration and lifecycle actions (setup, connect, pledge, doctor, spend, key rotation) across three surfaces that will soon grow to four:

1. **CLI** — `grob setup`, `grob exec`, `grob pledge`, `grob doctor`.
2. **Control Plane JSON-RPC** — four namespaces shipped in v0.31 (`server`, `model`, `provider`, `budget`).
3. **MCP tools** — a wizard MCP server exposing `wizard_*` functions that an AI agent can call.
4. **Future embedded UI** (B-1) — the browser surface.

Each surface currently implements its own command dispatch logic. The CLI embeds the setup wizard logic directly in `src/commands/setup.rs`. The JSON-RPC server re-implements lookups over the same state. The MCP wizard tools (introduced by [ADR-0008](0008-wizard-lifecycle.md)) are a third, partial implementation.

This duplication has already caused drift:

- A fix to preset resolution in the CLI was not applied to the JSON-RPC path.
- The MCP wizard tool for budget display shows a different format than `grob spend`.
- Adding a new wizard step means editing three files and remembering to keep them aligned.

[ADR-0008](0008-wizard-lifecycle.md) proposed a wizard lifecycle engine but scoped it to the setup/doctor/connect/auto_flow triad. The scope needs to expand.

## Decision Drivers

- **Single source of behavior** — one module decides what each action does; the surfaces are thin adapters.
- **Testable in isolation** — the engine must be a pure function `(state, action) -> (new_state, effects)` with no I/O, so it can be property-tested and fuzzed.
- **MCP-tools-first target** — instead of extending the JSON-RPC namespace map indefinitely, new control surfaces should be exposed as MCP tools. The current implementation still uses JSON-RPC as the shared control backend for both RPC clients and MCP wrappers.
- **Surface parity by construction** — adding an action to the engine automatically makes it reachable from all surfaces once each adapter routes the new action variant.
- **No extension of JSON-RPC** — deliberately constrain the RPC namespace surface area. MCP covers the growth path.

## Considered Options

1. **Extend the JSON-RPC namespace map** — add `keys`, `config`, `tools`, `hit`, `pledge` namespaces (rescue ADR-001's original plan). Rejected because MCP tools give the same reach without growing the schema, and because agents prefer tools over raw RPC.
2. **Keep three parallel implementations, wire them to a shared helper module** — insufficient; the helper grows into a de-facto engine without the discipline of pure functions.
3. **Introduce a pure `ControlEngine`** — `(state, action) -> new_state` module with **three** thin adapters (CLI, MCP, UI). Drop the RPC namespace expansion plan.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen: option 3.**

```

- **`ControlEngine`** (planned `src/control/engine.rs`) — pure state machine. Inputs: current `AppState` snapshot + `Action` enum. Outputs: new `AppState` + a list of `SideEffect` values describing what the adapter must actually do (spawn OAuth flow, write config file, call provider API).
- **CLI adapter** (`src/commands/`) — interprets side effects, shows progress to humans, returns exit codes.
- **MCP adapter** (`src/features/mcp/`) — exposes the action variants as MCP tools (`wizard_setup_start`, `wizard_select_preset`, `grob_configure`, …). The MCP surface grows with the engine, not with the JSON-RPC namespace map.
- **UI adapter** (future, B-1) — HTML + SSE + JWT embedded via `rust-embed`, consuming the same engine.

### JSON-RPC namespaces: target freeze, current divergence

Target contract: the four v0.31 namespaces (`server`, `model`, `provider`, `budget`) remain, and future growth goes through MCP tools rather than new raw RPC namespaces.

Current code diverges from that target. `keys`, `config`, `tools`, `hit`, and `pledge` are implemented as JSON-RPC namespaces and MCP tool calls are thin wrappers over the same RPC dispatcher. This is pragmatic for shared auth, state reload, and tests, but it means this ADR must not be read as evidence that those namespaces are absent.

Open product question: prototype a separate MCP proxy (stdio/http relay to an upstream such as `codex_apps`, in an isolated worktree), or keep Grob as the MCP server for its own control-plane only.

### Migration order

1. **A-1** — extract a `ControlEngine` skeleton with two actions (`SetupStart`, `SetupConfirm`) as proof of concept.
2. **A-2** — refactor the CLI commands one by one to go through the engine.
3. **A-3** — extend the MCP wizard tools to cover the engine's full action set.
4. **B-1** — implement the UI adapter on top of the same engine.

Sequenced: A-1 blocks A-2 / A-3 / B-1 (structural refactor, conflict risk).

## Consequences

### Positive

- **One source of truth** for what each action does. Tests run against the engine in isolation.
- Adding a new action once exposes it on all surfaces.
- MCP-first gives AI agents a natural path to drive Grob without needing raw RPC access.
- Reduces the incentive to grow the JSON-RPC schema, which is already frozen at v1 per [ADR-0001](0001-static-config-no-hot-reload.md).

### Negative

- The refactor is **structurally invasive**. Everything that currently touches `commands/*.rs`, `server/rpc/`, and `features/mcp/` is impacted. Expected ~2 days of work with conflicts.
- A pure engine plus side-effect list is a pattern unfamiliar to contributors used to direct I/O. Onboarding cost.
- MCP tools are less discoverable than RPC namespaces for non-AI consumers. Mitigation: each tool is listed with a description and example in `grob doctor`.

### Neutral / to watch

- The `self-tuning MCP tool` (`grob_configure`, shipped in PR #100 / v0.35.0) is the first production-ready MCP control surface. It is the canonical example of the MCP-tools-first pattern.
- Once the engine lands, the "command duplication" anti-pattern in `commands/` must be audited to confirm it has been eliminated.

## Follow-ups and related ADRs

- Extends [ADR-0008: Wizard Lifecycle Architecture](0008-wizard-lifecycle.md) — ADR-0008's state machine becomes a special case of the ControlEngine's action set. ADR-0008 was promoted to `accepted` on 2026-04-28; this dependency is now satisfied and chantiers A-1/A-2 are unblocked.
- [ADR-0009](0009-pledge-structural-tool-filtering.md), [ADR-0010](0010-universal-tool-layer.md) — modules that the engine orchestrates.
- [ADR-0013](0013-storage-files-no-redb.md) — engine state persistence lands on the files backend.
- Chantiers: A-1 (engine), A-2 (CLI thin), A-3 (MCP wizard extend) in the sprint menu.
- Current code: `src/control/engine.rs` (action parsing/roles), `src/server/rpc/` (JSON-RPC namespaces), `src/server/mcp_handlers/control_bridge.rs` (MCP-to-RPC bridge), `src/features/mcp/` (MCP tool matrix and tooling).
