# Licensing

Grob is dual-licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)** and a **commercial license**.

## Open Source License (AGPL-3.0)

The AGPL-3.0 applies by default. You are free to use, modify, and distribute Grob under its terms. Key obligations:

- If you modify Grob and provide it as a network service, you must make the source code of your modifications available to users of that service.
- Any derivative work must also be licensed under AGPL-3.0.
- See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the full legal text.

## Commercial Licensing

A commercial license is available for organizations that cannot or do not wish to comply with the AGPL-3.0 terms.

## Contributing

By submitting a pull request, you agree to the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](CLA.md). Contributors retain copyright on their contributions but grant A00 SASU the right to distribute those contributions under both the AGPL-3.0 and the commercial license.

This CLA is required so that A00 SASU can offer commercial licenses while keeping the open source version under AGPL-3.0.

## FAQ

### Can I use Grob internally at my company under AGPL-3.0?
Yes. Internal deployment does not trigger AGPL-3.0 source disclosure obligations. The obligation only applies when you make the software available to external users over a network.

### What if I modify Grob for internal use only?
You do not need to publish your modifications. AGPL-3.0 source disclosure only applies when providing the software as a service to third parties.

### Do I need a commercial license to use Grob with Claude Code?
No. Running Grob as a local proxy for your own development tools is personal/internal use, fully covered by AGPL-3.0.

### We are a 30-person company. Can we use Grob for free?
Yes. Organizations under 50 people can use Grob under the AGPL-3.0 at no cost, as long as they comply with the AGPL-3.0 terms.

### We are a defense contractor and need to audit the code.
The Source Available tier gives you full source access for audit purposes without AGPL-3.0 redistribution obligations. Contact licensing@a00.fr.
